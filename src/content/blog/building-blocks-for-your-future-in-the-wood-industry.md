## Is the wood industry financially sustainable?

This is likely a question that people who care about you and your future might ask, and the answer is yes. The financial benefits of a career in the wood industry can be achieved both immediately and in the future.

### Immediate Income

With the costs of a four-year college degree rapidly rising (US News and World Reports cites [2020-2021 rates](https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/paying-for-college/articles/paying-for-college-infographic#:~:text=The%20average%20cost%20of%20tuition,respectively%2C%20U.S.%20News%20data%20shows.) ranging between $10,000 and $35,000 for one year) and a 20% unemployment rate for new college graduates, embarking on a career without student loans immediately enhances your income potential. Additionally, you could have the possibility of earning money in your field right away. Unlike many skilled career paths, apprenticeships are the norm in many locations. Taking advantage of paid apprenticeships is one way to guarantee immediate income from the beginning of your career. While the income offered in apprenticeship positions range between $25,000 and $40,000 a year, the average across America is [$32,350](https://www.zippia.com/apprentice-carpenter-jobs/) with a growth expectancy of 8% by 2028.

### Future Income

After completing your apprenticeship or other training, there are several options for you depending on [your specialty](https://youwood.com/careers/). If consistency and stability are of high value to you, joining a well-established company with traditional benefits might be the right avenue for you to choose. Other options could include starting your own business or working for yourself as a sole proprietor. Regardless, an average salary across the nation is $65,000, with the high end being as much as $90,000 a year. If you add on the potential of tax write offs or a company vehicle, your compensation could be higher.

## Can the wood industry provide a sustainable career? 

Yes, it can - and there are varying paths to this sustainability. For the technology minded, a certification in computer-aided drafting (CAD) can set you apart with a specialization that will support your career growth. If working for yourself appeals to you, running your own business could be a part of your future. Whatever path you choose, the current and future need for the wood industry sets you up for on-going success.

**Current Need**

While many industries have struggled during the 2020 pandemic, the trade industry has seen continued growth. In fact, [PeopleReady.com](https://www.peopleready.com/skilled-trade-jobs-are-booming-in-pandemic-economy/) has seen growth in all trade construction-centric jobs in 2020, with a 16% increase in carpentry. This growth has occurred during a time when many industries have struggled, which demonstrates the stability of jobs in the wood industry and their ability to remain sustainable during days of economic downturn.

**Future Need**

The world seems to be moving at a record pace toward automation and digital processes for things that have traditionally been done by hand. How does this affect the growth potential in the wood industry? It actually opens doors for individuals embarking on a career in the field. In fact, a recent article, featured on [PBS.org](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/education/decades-pushing-bachelors-degrees-u-s-needs-tradespeople), highlighted the ever-increasing need for vocationally trained individuals.
